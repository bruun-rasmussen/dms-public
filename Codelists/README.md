This folder contains two types of codelists:

1. Codelists used in the [XML Guides](../XML%20Guides), to list permitted values for declaration elements. The Export XML Guide refers to codelists that can be found in "Codelists - AES" or "Codelists - Global". The Transit XML Guide refers to codelists that can be found in "Codelists - NCTS" or "Codelists - Global". "Codelists - Global" contains codelists that are mutual to Export and Transit. The Import XML Guide refers to codelists found in "Codelists - Import". 

2. Error and warning codelists. When receiving errors from DMS, the errors will contain a code that can be looked up for more info about the error. These codes can be looked up in "Error and warning codes" or "Validation rules and error codes". If the errors are related to DDNXA or DDNTA rules, they can be looked up in "Rules and Code - Transit" or "Rules and Code - Export".
