The Printing Guidelines for NCTS and AES have been prepared to help the National Customs Administrations during the transition from NCTS-P4 to P5 and from ECS-P2 to AES-P1 as regards the printing of the relevant declaration data.

The Printing Guidelines are composed of:
- an MS Word document containing specific information in form of text description and
- an MS Excel document containing a correlation table. It maps the declaration data elements of the new phases (NCTS-P5 and AES-P1) to the relevant boxes of the currently printed accompanying documents (NCTS-P4 and ECS-P2). Both documents should be read together as they are complementary.

Important to be noted is that the Printing Guidelines are applicable during the Transitional Period for NCTS and AES-P1, meaning that the currently used forms (TAD and EAD) defined by the Transitional Delegated Act (and the respective transitional measures set in the CTC Convention) shall be used until the end of the Transitional Period.
